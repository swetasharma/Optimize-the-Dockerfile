# Optimize-the-Dockerfile


Dockerfile (https://gist.github.com/prmishra/0ae5b40bff67bbad4a887f4b4052835d) which produces approximately 650MB size docker image.
optimize this Dockerfile to reduce size of the resultant docker image without changing behaviour of the application.
use multi-stage build and alpine image.
Ensure that you are able to create an image using the optimized Dockerfile before submitting.
the resultant docker image should be less than 10mb in size.
